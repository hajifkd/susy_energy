["\\def\\nle{{\\stackrel{<}{\\sim}}} We examine a possibility for existence of a light supersymmetric partner of the top quark (stop) with mass 15 $\\sim$ 16 GeV in the framework of the minimal supergravity GUT model. Such light stop could explain the slight excess of the high $p_{T}$ cross section of the $D^{*\\pm}$-meson production in two-photon process at TRISTAN. We point out that the existence of such stop could change the dominant decay mode of gluino and could weaken substantially present experimental bounds on the mass of gluino. It seems that there is a finite parameter region allowing existence of such light stop even if we consider the present experimental data. Inversely, if such light stop was discovered at TRISTAN, masses and mixing parameters of the other SUSY partners as well as masses of the Higgs and the top will be severely constrained, for example, $m_{\\tilde{g}}\\simeq$85GeV, $m_{\\tilde{W_{1}}}\\nle$50GeV, 110GeV$\\nle m_{\\tilde{\\ell}}\\nle$140GeV, 120GeV$\\nle m_{\\tilde{q}}\\nle$160GeV, $\u03b8_{t}\\simeq0.9$, $m_{h}\\nle$ 65GeV and 130GeV$\\nle m_{t}\\nle$140GeV. We also discuss briefly the proton decay and the dark matter constraints. \u25b3 Less", "I present a model for inflation based on the gaugino-dilaton dynamics of supersymmetry breaking. The inflaton is the dimension--1 scalar field $\u03c6$ related to the gaugino condensate via $\u03bb^T\u03bb=\u03c6^3.$ Recent work in this area is used to obtain two significant results: (1) Scalar density fluctuations at second horizon crossing are generated on scale $\u03bb$ with amplitude \\[ \\drr=A\\cdot \\ 10^3\\cdot\\ \\left(\\frac{m_{SUSY}}{m_{Pl}}\\right)^{\\half}\\ \\left(\\frac\u03bb{100\\ \\mbox{Mpc}}\\right)^{0.03}\\ \\ , \\] where $A$ is a constant which depends on (unknown) details of gaugino-dilaton dynamics in the strong-coupling phase.

We report here a general analysis without choosing a particular unification gauge group. We find that the encouraging SUSY unification results of recent years do survive the challenge of a more complete and accurate analysis. Taking into account effects at the 5-10% level leads to several improvements of previous results, and allows us to sharpen our predictions for SUSY in the light of unification. We perform a thorough study of the parameter space. The results form a well-defined basis for comparing the physics potential of different facilities. Very little of the acceptable parameter space has been excluded by LEP or FNAL so far, but a significant fraction can be covered when these accelerators are upgraded. A number of initial applications to the understanding of the SUSY spectrum, detectability of SUSY at LEP II or FNAL, BR($b\\to s\u03b3$), Width($Z\\to b\\bar b$), dark matter, etc, are included in a separate section. We formulate an approach to extracting SUSY parameters from data when superpartners are detected. For small tan(beta) or large $m_top$ both $M_half$ and $M_0$ are entirely bounded from above at O(1 tev) without having to use a fine-tuning constraint. \u25b3 Less", "In the SUSY GUT scenario, it is natural to assume the right-handed-neutrino Majorana-mass scale to be $10^{16}$ GeV.

This suggests that the solution of the solar-neutrino puzzle should be either the MSW effect in $\u03bd_e$--$\u03bd_\u03c4$ oscillations, with $ m_{\u03bd_\u03c4}^2 \\sim 10^{-5}\\, {\\rm eV}^2 $, or long-wavelength $\u03bd_e$--$\u03bd_\u03bc$ oscillations, with $ m_{\u03bd_\u03bc}^2 \\sim 10^{-10}\\, {\\rm eV}^2 $. These solutions require unexpectedly large mixings of $ \u03bd_e $ with $ \u03bd_\u03c4 $ and $ \u03bd_\u03bc $, respectively. I suggest a variation of the Dimopoulos--Hall--Raby model for the fermion mass matrices which can accomodate such large mixings. \u25b3 Less", "After a brief review of the flavour problem we present a new predictive framework based on SUSY $SO(10)$ theory, where the first family plays a role of the mass unification point. The inter-family hierarchy is first generated in a sector of superheavy fermions and then transfered in an inverse way to ordinary quarks and leptons by means of the universal seesaw mechanism. The obtained mass matrices are simply parametrized by two small coefficients which can be given by the ratio of the GUT and superstring compactification scales. The model allows a natural (without fine tuning) doublet-triplet splitting. It has a strong predictive power, though no special texture is utilized in contrast to the known predictive frameworks. Namely, the model implies that $m_b=4-5$ GeV, $m_s=100-150$ MeV, $m_u/m_d=0.5-0.7$ and $\\tan\u03b2<1.1$. The Top quark is naturally in the 100 GeV range, but not too heavy: $m_t<150$ GeV. All CKM mixing angles are in correct range. The Higgsino mediated $d=5$ operators for the proton decay are naturally suppressed. {On the basis of talks given at the XVI International Warsaw Meeting on Elementary Particle Physics \"New Physics with New Experiments\", Kazimierz, Poland, 24-28 May 1993, and at the II Gran Sasso Summer Institute \"From Particle Physics to Cosmology\", Gran Sasso National Laboratory, Italy, 6-17 September 1993.} \u25b3 Less", "We examine the radiative corrections to the mass of the lightest Higgs boson in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model. We use the renormalization-group improved effective potential which includes the next-to-leading-order contributions. We find that, contrary to the result of Espinosa and Quir\u00f3s, the higher-order corrections to the lightest Higgs boson mass are non-negligible, adding $3-11$ GeV ($3-9$ GeV) to the result in the leading logarithm approximation for the range of top quark mass $100 {\\rm GeV} < m_t < 200 {\\rm GeV}$ and for the supersymmetric breaking scale $M_{\\rm SUSY} = 1 {\\rm TeV}$ ($M_{\\rm SUSY} = 10 {\\rm TeV}$). Also we find that our result is stable under the change of the renormalization parameter $t$. \u25b3 Less", "In supersymmetric models, there are new CP violating phases which, if unsuppressed, would give a too large neutron electric dipole moment. We examine the possibility of small SUSY phases in string-inspired supergravity models in which supersymmetry is broken by the auxiliary components of the dilaton and moduli superfields. It is found that the SUSY phases can be suppressed by a small factor governing the breakdown of the approximate Peccei Quinn symmetries nonlinearly realized for the moduli superfields that participate in supersymmetry breaking. In many cases, the symmetry breaking factors are exponentially small for moderately large values of the moduli, leading to small phase values in a natural way. \u25b3 Less", "The scaling behavior and fixed points in the evolution of fermion Yukawa couplings and mixing angles are discussed. The relevance of fixed points in determining the top quark mass is described. \u25b3 Less", "The determination of the most straightforward evidence for the existence of the Superworld requires a guide for non-experts (especially experimental physicists) for them to make their own judgement on the value of such predictions. For this purpose we review the most basic results of Super-Grand unification in a simple and clear way. We focus the attention on two specific models and their predictions. These two models represent an example of a direct comparison between a traditional unified-theory and a string-inspired approach to the solution of the many open problems of the Standard Model. We emphasize that viable models must satisfy {\\em all} available experimental constraints and be as simple as theoretically possible. The two well defined supergravity models, $SU(5)$ and $SU(5)\\times U(1)$, can be described in terms of only a few parameters (five and three respectively) instead of the more than twenty needed in the MSSM model, \\ie, the Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model. A case of special interest is the strict no-scale $SU(5)\\times U(1)$ supergravity where all predictions depend on only one parameter (plus the top-quark mass). A general consequence of these analyses is that supersymmetric particles can be at the verge of discovery, lurking around the corner at present and near future facilities. This review should help anyone distinguish between well motivated predictions and predictions based on arbitrary choices of parameters in undefined models. \u25b3 Less", "A new procedure is developed which enables one to start from the quark and lepton mass and mixing data at the low scale and construct mass matrices which exhibit simple SO(10) structure at the SUSY GUT scale. This approach is applied to the present data involving quark and charged lepton masses, the CKM mixing matrix and the MSW solar neutrino and atmospheric neutrino depletion effects. In terms of just 12 model parameters suggested by the procedure for the 5 mass matrices, we can reproduce 15 masses and 8 mixing parameters remarkably consistent with the input starting values. \u25b3 Less", "The isolated like sign dilepton signature for gluino production is investigated at the LHC energy for the $R$ conserving as well as the $L$ and $B$ violating SUSY models over a wide range of the parameter space. One gets viable signals for gluino masses of 300 and 600 GeV for both $R$ conserving and $L$ violating models, while it is less promising for the $B$ violating case. For a 1000 GeV gluino, the $L$ violating signal should still be viable; but the $R$ conserving signal becomes too small at least for the low luminosity option of LHC. \u25b3 Less", "Linear collider designs are optimized for \\ep\\ collisions. However, from the physics point of view, \\lc s may also be advantageously operated in an \\ee, \\eg\\ or \\pp\\ mode.

It was generally believed that minimal SO(10) models predict wrong mass relations between the charged fermions of the first and second generations; furthermore, while the smallness of the neutrino masses in these models arises from the see-saw mechanism, it used to be thought that detailed predictions for neutrino masses and mixings require further adhoc assumptions. In this talk, I report some recent work with K.S.Babu, where we discovered that the minimal SO(10) model, both with and without SUSY, has in it a built-in mechanism that not only corrects the bad mass relations between the charged fermions but at the same time allows a complete prediction for the masses and mixings in the neutrino sector. We define our minimal model as the one that consists of the smallest set of Higgs multiplets that are needed for gauge symmetry breaking. Our result is based on the hypothesis that the complex {\\bf 10} of Higgs bosons has only a single coupling to the fermions. This hypothesis is guaranteed in supersymmetric models and in non-SUSY models that obey a softly broken Peccei-Quinn symmetry. \u25b3 Less", "We calculate the region of the MSSM parameter space (i.e. $M_{1/2}$, $m_{0}$, $\u03bc$, \\ldots) compatible with a correct electroweak breaking and a realistic top-quark mass. To do so we have included {\\em all} the one-loop corrections to the effective potential $V_{1}$ and checked their importance in order to obtain consistent results. We also consider the fine-tuning problem due to the enormous dependence of $M_{Z}$ on $h_{t}$ (the top Yukawa coupling), which is substantially reduced when the one-loop effects are taken into account. We also explore the reliability of the so-called \"standard\" criterion to estimate the degree of fine-tuning. As a consequence, we obtain a new set of upper bounds on the MSSM parameters or, equivalently, on the supersymmetric masses perfectly consistent with the present experimental bounds. \u25b3 Less", "In this paper we study and compare susy unification using two different approaches in order to take into account the effect of light particle thresholds on the evolution of gauge couplings: the step--function approximation, on the one hand, and a mass dependent procedure, which gives a more accurate description of the dependence of the results on the masses, on the other. We also include the effect of heavy thresholds, when $SU(5)$ is chosen as the unifying group. We find that the mass--dependent procedure excludes scenarios where all susy masses are below $1\\;TeV$, and favors a value of $\u03b1_3(m_Z)$ near its upper experimental bound, contrary to the results obtained with the step--function approximation. We underline the dependence of the results on the procedure chosen to deal with light thresholds. \u25b3 Less", "In the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) the existence of an upper bound on the mass of the $CP=+1$ lightest Higgs boson, equal to $m_Z$ at tree--level and $\\simlt 120\\ GeV$ after the inclusion of radiative corrections, has important phenomenological consequences for Higgs searches. A similar bound, independent of mass parameters other than the electroweak scale, can be calculated in supersymmetric models with an extended Higgs sector. In models with arbitrary Higgs sectors perturbative up to $10^{16}\\ GeV$, we find, including radiative corrections, $m_h \\simlt 155\\ GeV$ for $m_t \\simlt 190\\ GeV$. \u25b3 Less", "We point out a connection between R symmetry and \\susy\\ breaking. We show that the existence of an R symmetry is a necessary condition for \\susy\\ breaking and a spontaneously broken R symmetry is a sufficient condition provided two conditions are satisfied. These conditions are: {\\it genericity}, \\ie\\ the effective Lagrangian is a generic Lagrangian consistent with the symmetries of the theory (no fine tuning), and {\\it calculability}, \\ie\\ the low energy theory can be described by a supersymmetric Wess-Zumino effective Lagrangian without gauge fields. All known models of dynamical supersymmetry breaking possess such a spontaneously broken R symmetry and therefore contain a potentially troublesome axion. However, we use the fact that genericity is {\\it not} a feature of supersymmetric theories, even when nonperturbative renormalization is included, to show that the R symmetry can in many cases be explicitly broken without restoring supersymmetry and so the axion can be given an acceptably large mass. \u25b3 Less", "\\def\\nle{{\\stackrel{<}{\\sim}}} We examine a possibility for existence of a light supersymmetric partner of the top quark (stop) with mass 15 $\\sim$ 20 GeV in the framework of the minimal supergravity GUT model.

We point out that the existence of such stop could change the dominant decay mode of some particles and could weaken substantially present experimental bounds on the supersymmetric parameter space. It seems that there is a finite parameter region allowing existence of the light stop even if we consider the present experimental data.

We compute the running of the coupling constants of the Standard Model, between $m_Z$ and $M_P$, using a mass dependent subtraction procedure, and then compare the results with $\\bar{MS}$, and with the $\u03b8$-- function approximation. We also do this for the Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model. In the latter, the bounds on susy masses that one obtains by requiring perturbative unification are dependent, to some extent, on the procedure. \u25b3 Less", "The full parameter space of supergravity grand unified theory with $SU(5)$ type $p \\rightarrow \\bar\u03bd K$ proton decay is analysed using renormalization group induced electroweak symmetry breaking under the restrictions that the universal scalar mass $m_o$ and gluino mass are $\\leq 1$ TeV (no extreme fine tuning) and the Higgs triplet mass obeys $M_{H_3}/M_G < 10$. Future proton decay experiments at SuperKamiokande or ICARUS can reach a sensitivity for the $\\bar\u03bd K$ mode of $(2-5) \\times 10^{33}$ yr allowing a number of predictions concerning the SUSY mass spectrum.

On the other hand the unification mass is known. I argue that this situation is quite analogous (though opposite) to that in SUSY-GUTs in which the $U(1)$ normalization is known ($k_1=5/3$) but the unification mass $M_X$ is unknown. I emphasize that $k_1$ should be taken as a free parameter in the string approach (quite in the same way as $M_X$ is taken as a free parameter in SUSY-GUTs). If this is done, the success of the string approach concerning gauge coupling unification is comparable to that in SUSY-GUTs \u25b3 Less", "I analyze the predictions for the strong gauge coupling, $\u03b1_3(M_Z) $, and the top quark and light Higgs masses in the framework of gauge and bottom-tau Yukawa coupling unification in the minimal supersymmetric standard model. These predictions depend on the effective supersymmetric threshold scale $T_{SUSY}$, which is only very slightly dependent on the squark and slepton masses, and strongly dependent on the Higgsino masses as well as on the mass ratio of the gauginos of the strong and weak interactions. Within the minimal supersymmetry breaking scheme and for supersymmetric masses below or of the order of 1 TeV, I obtain $\u03b1_3(M_Z) \\geq 0.116$, while, if the running bottom quark mass at the physical mass is constrained to be $ m_b(M_b) \\leq 4.1 $GeV, then, for moderate values of $\\tan \u03b2$, perturbative unification is achieved only if $\u03b1_3(M_Z) \\leq 0.124$.

The emphasis is on the practical aspects leading to state-of-the-art calculations in this renascent subject. The topics covered include: generalities of supersymmetric unified theories, gauge and Yukawa coupling unification including the most up-to-date numerical analyses, soft supersymmetry breaking, and radiative electroweak symmetry breaking enforced using the tree-level and one-loop effective potentials. This class of supersymmetric models can be described in terms of five parameters: the top-quark mass ($m_t$), the ratio of Higgs vacuum expectation values ($\\tan\u03b2$), and three universal soft-supersymmetry-breaking parameters ($m_{1/2},m_0,A$).

A combined fit shows that indeed the MSGUT model can satisfy all these constraints simultaneously and the corresponding values for all SUSY masses are given within the minimal model, taking into account the complete second order renormalisation group equations for the couplings and the one-loop corrections to the Higgs potential for the calculation of the Z-mass and the Higgs masses.

For masses in this range, a variety of gluino decay modes can provide viable signatures for gluino detection. Apart from the classic missing transverse energy signal, the detection of high transverse momentum like-sign dileptons may be the cleanest signature for gluino production. Other signatures such as the production of a hard photon in the gluino cascade decay may also play an important role in confirming the supersymmetric origin of events originating from gluino production and decay. \u25b3 Less", "Supersymmetry (SUSY) has many well known attractions, especially in the context of Grand Unified Theories (GUTs).

Domain walls between vacua of non-equal cosmological constant fall in three classes depending on the value of their energy density $\u03c3$: (i) extreme walls with $\u03c3=\u03c3_{ext}$ are planar, static walls corresponding to the supersymmetric configurations, (ii) non-extreme walls with $\u03c3>\u03c3_{ext}$ are expanding bubbles with two insides, (iii) ultra-extreme walls with $\u03c3<\u03c3_{ext}$ are bubbles of false vacuum decay. As a prototype exhibiting all three types of configurations vacuum walls between Minkowski and anti-deSitter vacua are discussed. Space-times associated with these walls exhibit non-trivial causal structure closely related to the one of the corresponding extreme and non-extreme charged black holes, however, without singularities. Recently discovered extreme dilatonic walls, pertinent to string theory, are also addressed. They are static, planar domain walls with metric in the string frame being {\\it flat} everywhere. Intriguing similarities between the global space-time of dilatonic walls and that of charged dilatonic black holes are pointed out. \u25b3 Less", "In the last 20 years we have accumulated an enormous amount of data on elementary particles and their interactions. This data serves two purposes: to fix the phenomenological parameters of the Standard Model [SM] and to verify that the SM is an excellent description of nature. It is our goal to understand the origin of these many arbitrary parameters. In this talk we consider a supersymmetric [SUSY] SO(10) grand unified theory [GUT]. We present a straightforward procedure, incorporating a general operator analysis, which allows us to use low energy data to determine the fermionic sector of the theory at the GUT scale. \u25b3 Less", "Properties and experimental predictions of a broad class of supergravity grand unified models possessing an $SU(5)$-type proton decay and $R$ parity are described. Models of this type can be described in terms of four parameters at the Gut scale in addition to those of the Standard Model i.e. $m_o$ (universal scalar mass), $m_{1/2}$ (universal gaugino mass), $A_o$ (cubic soft breaking parameter) and $\\tan\u03b2=<H_2>/<H_1>$. Thus the 32 SUSY masses can be expressed in terms of $m_o, m_{1/2}, A_o \\tan\u03b2$ and the as yet unknown t-quark mass $m_t$. Gut thresholds are examined and a simple model leads to grand unification consistent with $p$-decay data when $0.114<\u03b1_3 (M_z)<0.135$, in agreement with current values of $\u03b1_3 (M_Z)$.Proton decay is examined for the superheavy Higgs triplet mass $M_{H_3}<10M_G(M_G\\simeq 1.5 \\times10^{16}$~GeV) and squarks and gluinos lighter than 1 TeV. Throughout most of the parameter space chargino-neutralino scaling relations are predicted to hold: $2m_{\\tilde{Z}_1}\\cong m_{\\tilde{W}_1}\\cong m_{\\tilde{Z}_2}, m_{\\tilde{W}_1}\\simeq(1/4)m_{\\tilde{g}}$ (for $\u03bc>0$) or $m_{\\tilde{W}_1} \\simeq(1/3)m_{\\tilde{g}}$ (for $\u03bc<0$), while $m_{\\tilde{W}_2}\\cong m_{\\tilde{Z}_3}\\cong m_{\\tilde{Z}_4}>>m_{\\tilde{Z}_1}$. Future proton decay experiments combined with LEP2 lead to further predictions, e.g. for the entire parameter space either proton decay should be seen at these or the$\\tilde{W}_1$ seen at LEP2. Relic density constraints on the $\\tilde{Z}_1$ further constrain the parameter space e.g. so that $m_t<165$~GeV, $m_h<105$~GeV, $m_{\\tilde{W}_1} <100$~GeV and $m_{\\tilde{Z}_1}<50$~GeV when $M_{H_3}/M_G < 6$.

They show a certain lack of universality, but not dangerous for flavor changing neutral currents. To get more quantitative results a specific SUSY breaking mechanism has to be considered, namely gaugino condensation in the hidden sector. Then, it turns out that squark and slepton masses tend to be much larger than scalar masses ($m_\u03c6 > 10 M_a$), which probably is a quite general fact. Experimental bounds and the requirement of a successful electroweak breaking without fine tuning impose further restrictions on the soft breaking terms. As a consequence the gluino and chargino masses should be quite close to their present experimental limits, whereas squark and slepton masses should be much higher (> 1 TeV). \u25b3 Less", "We review some recent results and future prospects in the phenomenology of Supersymmmetry.

It will be shown that the $e\u03b3$ colliders would be more suitable in searching for the heavy selectrons than $ee$ colliders because of the low mass threshold of the process $e\u03b3\\goto \\sele\\sz1$. We show that the standard background processes $e\u03b3\\goto \u03bdW$ and $eZ$ can be suppressed in terms of initial beam polarization as well as the kinematical cuts on the energy and angle of the final electron. Moreover, it will be argued that the experimental measurements of the cross sections for the processes $e\u03b3\\goto \\sele\\sz1$ and $\u03b3\u03b3\\goto \\sfb\\sf$ could enable us to constrain the basic parameters in the MSSM. This is originated from the simplicity of SUSY parameter dependence of these processes.

We present a mechanism which naturally suppresses such dimension 5 operators in the context of SUSY $SO(10)$. The mechanism, which implements natural doublet--triplet splitting using the adjoint higgs, converts these dimension 5 operators effectively into dimension 6. By explicitly computing the higgs spectrum and the resulting threshold uncertainties we show that the successful prediction of $\\sin^2\u03b8_W$ is maintained {\\it as a prediction} in this scheme. It is argued that only a weak suppression of the higgsino mediated proton decay is achievable within SUSY $SU(5)$ without fine--tuning, in contrast to a strong suppression in SUSY $SO(10)$. \u25b3 Less", "The status of coupling constant unification (with and without a unification of Yukawa couplings) is discussed. Uncertainties associated with the input coupling constants, $m_{b}$ and $m_{t}$, threshold corrections at the low and high scale, and possible nonrenormalizable operators are described and a discrepancy between effective and physical scales is pointed out. Theoretical uncertainties in the predictions of $\u03b1_{s}(M_{Z})$, $m_{b}$, and the unification scale, $M_{G}$, are discussed and estimated. Constraints on the super-partner spectrum are found to be weak if uncertainties associated with the high-scale are included.

We then describe how to set up and run an ISAJET / ISASUSY job and the user input and output formats. The ISAJET program is sufficiently flexible that some non-minimal supersymmetry scenarios may be simulated as well.

The monopole moving through an axion domain wall is transformed into a monopole bag - the state with a dyon quantum number, but smaller mass. In the case of an axion membrane the passing monopole excites the chiral charged state at the membrane boundary. It will be shown that if cosmic string intersects an axion domain wall there will be $\u03b8= \u03c0$, i.e. maximal $CP$-violation inside the string. Strings carrying the flux of the $Z$-boson field become the sources of the baryon charge nonconservation. The symbiosis of the two pictures - monopole passing through an axion domain wall and string intersecting it - is the case of the interaction between an axion domain wall and a Nambu electroweak string carrying $SU(2)_{L}$ monopoles at the ends. \u25b3 Less", "In minimal SUSY-GUT models with $M_{SUSY}\\alt 1$ TeV, the renormalization group equations have a solution dominated by the infrared fixed point of the top Yukawa coupling.

Any successful model of physics beyond the Standard Model must be consistent with these observations. The impact of radiative corrections on the Minimal Supersymmetric Model (MSSM) is considered. The influence of supersymmetric particles on precision electroweak measurements is generally negligible since radiative corrections mediated by supersymmetric particles are suppressed by a factor of order $m_Z^2/M_{\\rm SUSY}^2$ (where $M_{\\rm SUSY}$ is the scale characterizing the scale of supersymmetric particle masses). However, there are a few pertinent exceptions. For example, the radiative corrections to the rare decay $b\\to s\u03b3$ from charged Higgs and supersymmetric particle exchange can be of the same order as the Standard Model contribution. Large radiative corrections also lead to modifications of MSSM tree-level (natural) relations. The largest corrections of this type occur in the MSSM Higgs sector and are enhanced by powers of the top quark mass. The consequences of the radiatively corrected MSSM Higgs sector are briefly discussed. \u25b3 Less", "We discuss the large radiative corrections to the masses of supersymmetric Higgs bosons in the MSSM and in its simplest extension, the NMSSM, with particular attention paid to the bounds on the lightest CP-even Higgs mass found in both models. In the case of the MSSM, these corrections are found to be primarily associated with the effects top quark and stop squark loops, while for extended models they also include significant contributions from Higgs and Higgsino loops.

Among the various reaction channels that could lead to sparticle production at HERA, only the following are within its limit of sensitivity in this model: $e^-p\\to \\tilde e^-_{L,R}\u03c7^0_i+X, \\tilde \u03bd_e\u03c7^-_1+X$, where $\u03c7^0_i(i=1,2)$ are the two lightest neutralinos and $\u03c7^-_1$ is the lightest chargino. We study the elastic and deep-inelastic contributions to the cross sections using the Weizs\u00e4cker-Williams approximation. We find that the most promising supersymmetric production channel is right-handed selectron ($\\tilde e_{R}$) plus first neutralino ($\u03c7^0_1$), with one hard electron and missing energy signature. The $\\tilde\u03bd_e\u03c7^-_1$ channel leads to comparable rates but also allows jet final states. A right-handedly polarized electron beam at HERA would shut off the latter channel and allow preferentially the former one.

In the presence of an extra pseudo-anomalous gauged- ${U(1)}_X$, the value of the weak angle may be computed purely in terms of the charges of the massless fermions of the theory, independently of the details of the massive string sector. I present the simplest such $ {U(1)}_X$ which leads to the canonical result $sin^2\u03b8_W=3/8$ in the supersymmetric standard model. This is a sort of gauged Peccei-Quinn symmetry which requires the presence of just the minimal set of Higgs doublets and forbids dimension-four $B$ and $L$-violating terms. In this approach the cancellation of the $U(1)_X$ anomalies through a Green-Schwarz mechanism plays a crucial role. In a different context (that of non-string low-energy supersymmetric models) I briefly discuss wether this type of anomaly cancellation mechanism could be of phenomenological relevance close to the electroweak scale.

We derive an expression for the effective scale, $T_{SUSY}$, which characterizes the supersymmetric particle threshold corrections to the gauge couplings, and demonstrate that $T_{SUSY}$ is only slightly dependent on the squark and slepton masses, and strongly dependent on the Higgsino masses as well as on the mass ratio of the gauginos of the strong and weak interactions. Moreover, the value of the top quark Yukawa coupling necessary to achieve the unification of bottom and tau Yukawa couplings is also governed by $T_{SUSY}$, and it yields predictions for the top quark mass which are close to the quasi infrared fixed point results associated with the triviality bounds on this quantity. From the requirement of perturbative consistency of the top quark Yukawa sector of the theory, we obtain constraints on the allowed splitting of the supersymmetric spectrum, which, for certain values of the running bottom quark mass, are stronger than those ones coming from the experimental constraints on the strong gauge coupling. \u25b3 Less", "The predictions of SU(5) supergravity models with radiative breaking constrained by experimental proton decay bounds are discussed.

Suitable high energy photon beams may be provided at linear colliders by back-scattering laser beams on electron beams. The final states considered represent a typical signature for the production and decay of selctron and chargino pairs within the \\mssm. We show that, away from the kinematical threshold, selctrons produce this signal far more abundantly than charginos. The standard model background is dominated by W-pair production. We propose a series of kinematical cuts which reduce this background to an acceptable level.

We assume that the needed suppression is not due to a fine-tuning of phases or masses, and ask what natural size of $CP$ violation (CPV) results. We show that (1) the phase of one of the superpotential parameters, $\u03bc$, does not contribute to any CPV in the MSSM and so is not constrained by \\dn; (2) the MSSM contribution to $d_n$ is tiny, just coming from the CKM phase; (3) the phases in the MSSM cannot be used to generate a baryon asymmetry at the weak scale, given our assumptions; and (4) in non-minimal SUSY models, an effective phase can enter at one loop giving $d_n \\sim 10^{-26}$\\ecm, $d_e \\sim 10^{-27}$\\ecm, and allowing a baryon asymmetry to be generated at the weak scale, without fine-tunings.

This result would persist even for the ultimate LEPI lower bound ($M_H\\gsim70\\GeV$). We show that this situation is a consequence of a decoupling phenomenon in the Higgs sector driven by radiative electroweak breaking for increasingly larger sparticle masses, and thus it should be common to a large class of supergravity models. A consequence of $m_h\\gsim60\\GeV$ in the minimal $SU(5)$ supergravity model is the exclusion from the allowed parameter space of `spoiler modes' ($\u03c7^0_2\\to\u03c7^0_1 h$) which would make the otherwise very promising trilepton signal in $p\\bar p\\to\u03c7^\\pm_1\u03c7^0_2X$ unobservable at Fermilab. Within this model we also obtain stronger upper bounds on the lighter neutralino and chargino masses, \\ie, $m_{\u03c7^0_1}\\lsim50\\GeV$, $m_{\u03c7^0_2,\u03c7^\\pm_1}\\lsim100\\GeV$.

Minimal supergravity is characterized by two higgs doublets at the electroweak scale, gauge coupling unification, and universal soft-SUSY breaking at the unification scale. We have searched for the allowed parameter space that avoids washout of baryon number via unsuppressed anomalous Electroweak sphaleron processes after the phase transition. This requirement imposes strong constraints on the Higgs sector. With respect to weak scale baryogenesis, we find that the generic MSSM is {\\it not} phenomenologically acceptable, and show that the additional experimental and consistency constraints of minimal supergravity restricts the mass of the lightest CP-even Higgs even further to $m_h\\lsim 32\\GeV$ (at one loop), also in conflict with experiment. Thus, if supergravity is to allow for baryogenesis via any other mechanism above the weak scale, it {\\it must} also provide for B-L production (or some other `accidentally' conserved quantity) above the electroweak scale. Finally, we suggest that the no-scale flipped $SU(5)$ supergravity model can naturally and economically provide a source of B-L violation and realistically account for the observed ratio $n_B/n_\u03b3\\sim 10^{-10}$. \u25b3 Less"]
